# Student-Grievance-System

•This was a Smart India Hackathon (SIH) project created for Andhra Pradesh State Governament to manage the complaints filed by the Students.

•In colleges if anyone wants to raise complaint then one has to write on a paper and wait for the respond to whom it’s
addressed.
•
Student has to signup/login and raise complain about the issues he finds.
•
Admin has to login through his login id and can view the complaints that has been raised by the students.
•
Based on the categories Admin can filter the complaints as Department level, Institute Level or University level . Further,
Admin can subcategorise the complaints as for Admission, Finance, Exams, Lecture, Timetable, Paper Re evaluation,
Others.
•
Later, Admin can sort complaints based on some priorities or keywords.
•
In this system, the admin can view the complaint details and takes further actions required accordingly. Each complaint
will have a definite time limit associated with it.
•
After expiry of time the complaint gets promoted to Institute level and if moreover, the Institute takes no action then
the same complaint gets promoted to University level wherein a mail is forwarded to University through a predefined
mail. This makes it easier for the University to recognise that the complaint is came from the Grievance System.
•
The student gets the notification whether the complaint is IN PROCESS or it has been CLOSED by the Admin ON
Dashboard.
•
Student needs to check the complaint status whereas Admin needs to check the complaint regularly to see whether new
complaint has been filed or not.
